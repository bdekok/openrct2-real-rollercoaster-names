# OpenRCT2 Real rollercoaster names

Are you also often blankly looking at your screen, trying to figure out how to name your new custom build rollercoaster?
Do you have Corkscrew Rollercoaster 1, 2 and 3 in your park?

Fear not this plugin will help you. When you create a new rollercoaster the script will pick a random name from a real existing rollercoaster of the same type.
